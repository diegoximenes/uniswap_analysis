A brief guide on some Uniswap protocol concepts.
This article was written so I can revisit these concepts in the future, since Uniswap V3 whitepaper is not so explicit and didactic.
However I realized it can also be useful to other people.
It includes some approaches and opinions that were not found in the current literature.
Target audience are people who have some familiarity on how Uniswap operates, at least on an user (liquidity provider and trader) level.
